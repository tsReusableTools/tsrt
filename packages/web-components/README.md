# Typescript Reusable Tools: Web-components

Lib for shared reusable web-components and services.

Components are build using:
1. Svelte framework (via `custom-elements` API)
2. Native web-components API (via `custom-elements` API)

## Important

Until version 1.0.0 Api should be considered as unstable and may be changed.

So prefer using exact version instead of version with `~` or `^`.
